This is a take-home assignment/project for SignHouse.

## Getting Started

### Run it locally

First, make sure to install the required dependencies

*Note: This project was developed using pnpm and was not tested on either npm/yarn, although that shouldn't cause any issues I cannot guarantee it.*

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn i
# or
pnpm i
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

That's it!

## Tech used

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React Query with Axios
- Mantine with Lucide icons

## Project structure

This project, despite being relatively simple, loosely follows the [react-bulletproof](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md) structure as in my humble experience it worked out really great for me throughout the years (regardless of project complexity). And I like my stuff to be neat.
